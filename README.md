# Induction
A mini guide to help those struggling with weak induction for their discrete mathematics class

# Things to note:

- Treat this purely as a guide and not a fixed way of doing induction.

- You may do the steps differently from mine which is completely fine as long as you don't miss out on crucial steps.

- I may not cover all aspects of weak induction so sorry for that 🙏
  I'll try my best to update this guide with more stuff later or if anyone can help with it that would also be fine 

- That's all, good luck :D
  (do star the repo if u found it useful, tq 🙏)
